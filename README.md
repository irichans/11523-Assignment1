Project Title: Assignment-1 Predictive Modelling of Eating-Out Problem

Project Description:
In this project, I will perform predictive modeling and deployment based on a real-world dataset comprising over 10,000 restaurant records from Sydney in 2018. The objective is to predict restaurant success using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes a variety of features, such as restaurant name, address, rating, cuisine type, and cost, among others.
This project has three main parts:
Analyzing variables, including cost, rating and type of restaurants, and vislualizing them using histograms, stacked bar charts, and cuisine density map.
Building two regression linear models to predict restaurant rating using various of features. And building a classification model to categorize restaurants based on their ratings.
Using tableau to show diagrams, and deploy the code and model on GitHub and Docker Hub.

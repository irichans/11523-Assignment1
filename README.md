Project Title: Assignment-1 Predictive Modelling of Eating-Out Problem

Project Description:
In this project, I will perform predictive modelling and deployment based on a real-world dataset comprising over 10,000 restaurant records from Sydney in 2018. The objective is to predict restaurant success using machine learning techniques. The dataset includes a variety of features, such as restaurant name, address, rating, cuisine type, and cost, among others.

This project has three main parts:

- Analyzing variables, including cost, rating and type of restaurants, and visualizing them using histograms, stacked bar charts, and the cuisine density map.

- Building two regression linear models to predict restaurant ratings using various of features. And building a classification model to categorize restaurants based on their ratings.

- Using Tableau to show diagrams, and deploy the code and model on GitHub and Docker Hub.

How to Install and Run the Project

This project includes two parts, which are Part A and Part B, accompanied by a dataset (CSV file) and a GeoJSON file. You need to install Python, Jupyter Notebook, and Git to view it. Once you install all those applications, you can load the data and look into it. If the system warns that can not find the file, please change the path of loading data to the place where you load the data.

What you can expect from this project?
Through this project, you will gain an in-depth understanding of the cuisines, distribution, and the relationship between ratings and approximate prices of Sydney restaurants. Additionally, various charts will visually present the trends and patterns. Furthermore, you will explore the impact of different variables on restaurant ratings through models.
